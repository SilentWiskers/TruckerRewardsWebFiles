# TruckerRewardsWebFiles
Web files for a trucker rewards website project.
This project allowed a truck driver to join a sponsor and earn reward point for safe driving. Truck drivers could log in, join a sponsor, and purchase products from that sponsor with thier reward points. Sponsors could also create an account and add or manage truck drivers. Sponsors link their catalog to products from Amazon.com and can manage their inventory. An Admin acount also exists to manage the website and accounts.
